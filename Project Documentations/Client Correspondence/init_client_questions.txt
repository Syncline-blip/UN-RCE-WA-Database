Organise a meeting sometime next week before meeting with client to discuss questions to ask 

What technologies are we working with? Is there a stack in place already? Is there a website in place already? Anything already exists that interacts with the database we are making? 

In regards to uploads, what are the quality of the photos expected? Any videos required? 
Working with reports and data, how sensitive is the information going to be? Ensuring the information is secured

Scale of how many people would be using this website? 20 or 2000? 

In terms of the uploading, do we need a feature to tag, search or categorise them? 

Do they need a profile functionality? With their own profile? Filtering of reports? 

Assuming we have to build an interface, would there need to be a feature to comment on other peoples reports?
